## Introduction

The "Docker Repository" simplifies building and running applications, establishes CI/CD standards, and ensures secure deployment. Available at: [izalke/docker-repo](https://github.com/izalke/docker-repo).

---

## Project Structure

- **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building the Docker image.
- **.github/workflows**: YAML files for GitHub Actions workflows.
- **README.md**: Documentation with setup and execution instructions.
- **Auxiliary Files**: Scripts for initialization and configuration.

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites

- Installed Docker.
- Sufficient disk space for images.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izalke/docker-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd docker-repo
   ```
3. Activate the environment (if applicable):
   ```bash

## CI/CD Automation

GitHub Actions automates the build, test, and deployment processes using YAML files in `.github/workflows`. Workflows execute automatically after pushing changes.

---

## Security Analysis

**Trivy** analyzes Docker images for vulnerabilities, ensuring secure and reliable software. Regular scans in CI/CD pipelines help prevent potential security issues.
